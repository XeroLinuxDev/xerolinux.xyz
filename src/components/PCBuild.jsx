 * This module defines a React component 'PCBuild' that displays information about a PC build.
 * This component uses an image from local assets and two components: 'Title' and 'Img'.
 * It returns a JSX that contains a title, image, and a description about a PC Build.
 * There's a styled paragraph 'p' component with some text and styles conditionally applied based on the 'center' and 'small' props which are passed to it.
 * Lastly, this component is exported as a default export to be used in other JavaScript modules.

        That PC is my main one acting as my everyday system. I do all my gaming
        on it. It is a "Beast". I use it to build <span>XeroLinux</span> and other projects. It's
        an AMD Ryzen build. Click button below to check out build parts on PC

        At this point in time, this beast is running <span>Windows 11 Pro</span> / <span>XeroLinux </span>
        in Dual-Boot, until I decide otherwise.
